## 📚 Introduction
**AegisGraph** is a high-performance graph library written in **C++** with Python bindings. It is designed to provide a fast and efficient alternative to popular graph libraries such as:

- **NetworkX** – Graph analysis library in Python.
- **PyG (PyTorch Geometric)** – Deep learning framework for graph-based learning.

AegisGraph focuses on **hardware efficiency, memory optimization, and security**, offering superior speed and scalability in graph operations.

## 🎯 Why Choose AegisGraph?

### 🔥 Key Advantages
- **Adjacency List Representation:**  
  Optimized graph storage that enhances memory efficiency and query speed compared to sparse matrix representations.
- **C++ Backend for Maximum Performance:**  
  Core operations are implemented in C++ with minimal overhead, ensuring faster graph processing.
- **Secure and Efficient Random Walks:**  
  Utilizes **Pseudorandom Number Generators (PRNGs)** instead of Python’s `random.choice()` for secure and reproducible random walks.
- **Optimized RAM Usage:**  
  Memory-efficient graph loading and neighbor queries for handling large-scale graphs.
- **No PyTorch Dependency:**  
  Lightweight deployment without heavy dependencies, making it ideal for various environments.

---

## ⚡ Core Features
- 📡 **Graph Construction:** Supports directed, undirected, and weighted graphs.
- 🔄 **Random Walks with PRNG:** Secure and hardware-efficient random walk implementation.
- 🕸️ **Graph Algorithms:** Supports BFS, DFS, Dijkstra’s, and other common algorithms.
- 🧠 **Fast Neighbor Queries:** Constant-time neighbor access through adjacency lists.
- 📊 **Graph Serialization:** Save and load graphs efficiently.

## 🛠️ Installation

### 📦 Prerequisites
- **C++ Compiler:** GCC, Clang, or MSVC supporting C++17 or later.
- **Python (Optional for Bindings):** Version 3.10 or higher.
- **CMake:** For building the library.

### ⚙️ Building from Source

#### 1. Clone the Repository
```bash
git clone https://github.com/your-username/aegisgraph.git
cd aegisgraph
mkdir build
cd build
cmake ..
make
```

#### 2. Install the Python Bindings

🐍 Python Usage
```python
import aegisgraph

# Create a graph instance
graph = aegisgraph.Graph()

# Add edges
graph.add_edge(0, 1)
graph.add_edge(1, 2)
graph.add_edge(2, 3)
graph.add_edge(3, 0)

graph.getNeighbor(1)

# Perform a random walk
path = graph.random_walk(0, 10)
print(f"Random walk path: {path}")
```

---

#### Install with pip
```bash
python3 -m venv .aegisgraph-env
source .aegisgraph-env/bin/activate
pip install --upgrade pip build
pip install -e .
```


🚀 Graph Loading Speed
AegisGraph achieves a 3x speed improvement in loading large-scale graphs compared to NetworkX.
